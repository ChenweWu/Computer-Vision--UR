Multi-Label Actor-Action Classification 
Description: Build a model to predict classes of actor and action in each frame. Since some frames may have multiple actors
performing different actions, this is a multi-label classification problem. Note that you should NOT use ground-truth bounding
boxes or semantic segmentation map in training or testing stage.
Evalutaion Metric(s): We use precision, recall, and F1-score to measure performance of trained models. The descriptions about
the three metrics can be found in course slides or
https://towardsdatascience.com/accuracy-precision-recall-or-f1-331fb37c5cb9.
Performance Expectation: We expect your model performance should be better than Precision: 23.8 Recall: 30.5 F1: 25.2.
