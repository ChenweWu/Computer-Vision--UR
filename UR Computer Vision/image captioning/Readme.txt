LSTM-based Language Decoder
I built a LSTM-based language encoder-decoder network based on the defined layers in
the network.py. thee decoder mainly consists of three layers: a word embedding layer, a one-layer LSTM, and
a linear (fully-connected) layer, capable of captioning pictures.

Please check Image Captioning.pdf for the performance
